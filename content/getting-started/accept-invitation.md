PC), you can easily open it on another device by scanning a code. Click the
'Send to mobile device' button and follow the instructions.

## Step 2: Install the app

If you don't have the Snikket app installed on your device yet, use the button
for your platform to install the app. Snikket currently has apps for Android
and iOS.

**No Android or iOS device available?** Scroll to the bottom of the invitation
page and click the link to register an account manually. Follow the
instructions to create an account, and enter your credentials into any
[compatible software](https://snikket.org/faq/#q-can-i-use-non-snikket-apps-to-connect-to-a-snikket-server)
for your platform.

## Step 3: Create your account

Open the Snikket app and follow the instructions.

If you are greeted by the welcome screen, you need to go back to the
invitation page again, but this time tap the 'Open the app' button on that
page to launch the app and begin the account setup.

As part of the account setup process, you will choose a username and password.

## Step 4: Understanding circles and contacts

Once you've created your account and opened the Snikket app, you'll see that
you've automatically been added to a group chat.

This is the default group chat of the circle you've been invited to when you
created your account. Everyone who is already part of this circle is also
automatically added to your contact list.

You can can now start using Snikket! Enjoy!
